ALYS DB 002 JPN
Codename ALYS4AE JP. This is the first publicly released Japanese vocal library along with ALYS4AE FR.

This is a modified version of the ALYS DB 002 JPN voicebank that is configured to work in UTAU. It only contains the recordings from DB 002 and lacks some samples to create a full VCV voicebank.
This is a monopitch VCV voicebank.

Recommended Resampler: moresampler
ALYS has very slow consonants, so a high consonant velocity will help her a lot.
